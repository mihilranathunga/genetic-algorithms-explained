                <h3>What are Genetic Algorithms?</h3>
                <h5>" Computer programs that evolve in ways that resemble natural selection, can solve complex problems
                    even their creators do not fully understand. "</h5>

                <p>Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive methods which may be used to solve search and optimization
                    problems. They are based on the genetic processes of biological organisms. Over many generations,
                    natural populations evolve according to the principles of natural selection and "survival of the
                    fittest", first clearly stated by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species . By mimicking this
                    process, genetic algorithms are able to "evolve" solutions to real world problems, if they have
                    been suitably encoded. For example, GAs can be used to design bridge structures, for maximum
                    strength/weight ratio, or to determine the least wasteful layout for cutting shapes from cloth.
                    They can also be used for on-line process control, such as in a chemical plant, or load
                    balancing on a multi-processor computer system.</p>

                <p>The basic principles of GAs were first laid down rigorously by <a
                        href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/adaptation-natural-and-artificial-systems" target="_blank">Adaptation
                    in Natural and Artificial Systems</a>, and are well described in many texts (e.g. <a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Genetic-Algorithms-Simulated-Annealing-Lawrence/dp/0273087711/"
                        target="_blank">Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, </a><a
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Genetic-Algorithms-Lawrence-David/dp/0442001738/"
                        target="_blank">Handbook of Genetic Algorithms, </a><a
                        href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/79.543973" target="_blank">Genetic algorithms and their
                    applications, </a>etc.) GAs simulate those processes in natural populations which are essential to
                    evolution. Exactly which biological processes are essential for evolution, and which processes have
                    little or no role to play is still a matter for research; but the foundations are clear. In nature,
                    individuals in a population compete with each other for resources such as food, water and shelter.
                    Also, members of the same species often compete to attract a mate. Those individuals which are most
                    successful in surviving and attracting mates will have relatively larger numbers of offspring.
                    Poorly performing individuals will produce few of even no offspring at all. This means that the
                    genes from the highly adapted, or "fit" individuals will spread to an increasing number of
                    individuals in each successive generation. The combination of good characteristics from different
                    ancestors can sometimes produce "super fit" offspring, whose fitness is greater than that of either
                    parent. In this way, species evolve to become more and more well suited to their environment.</p>

                <p>solution to a given problem. Each individual is assigned a "fitness score" according to how good
                    a solution to the problem it is. For example, the fitness score might be the strength/weight
                    ratio for a given bridge design. (In nature this is equivalent to assessing how effective an
                    organism is at competing for resources.) The highly fit individuals are given opportunities to
                    "reproduce", by "cross breeding" with other individuals in the population. This produces new
                    individuals as "off spring", which share some features taken from each "parent". The least fit
                    members of the population are less likely to get selected for reproduction, and so "die
                    out".</p>

                <p>A whole new population of possible solutions is thus produced by selecting the best individuals
                    from the current "generation", and mating them to produce a new set of individuals. This new
                    generation contains a higher proportion of the characteristics possessed by the good members of
                    the previous generation. In this way, over many generations, good characteristics are spread
                    throughout the population, being mixed and exchanged with other good characteristics as they go.
                    By favoring the mating of the more fit individuals, the most promising areas of the search space
                    are explored. If the GA has been designed well, the population will converge to an optimal
                    solution to the problem.</p>

                <h3>The infamous<span class="text-muted"> Eight Queens</span> problem</h3>

                <p class="shot-para">The original eight queens problem consisted of trying to find a way to place eight
                    queens on a chessboard so that no queen would attack any other queen. An alternate way of expressing
                    the problem is to place eight “anythings” on an eight by eight grid such that none of them share a
                    common row, column, or diagonal.</p>

                <p class="shot-para">It has long been known that there are 92 solutions to the problem. Of these 92,
                    there are 12 distinct patterns. All of the 92 solutions can be transformed into one of these 12
                    unique patterns using rotations and reflections.</p>

                <p class="shot-para">The 12 basic solutions can be constructed using the following table. For example,
                    if you are constructing solution number 1, then the Queen for chessboard row 1 should be placed in
                    column 1, the Queen for row 2 should be placed in column 5, etc. A diagram showing solution number 1
                    appears below the table.</p>
